FE------>BE------->password to be hashed before reaching db---->DB

Signin
re run the hash and compare with DB

but if 2 users have same the same password then they have the same hash which is a security vulnerability

so we do SALTING--adding a random string after the password and create a hash with it and also store the salt with it
                  now we would have 2 differrent hash since the string was random
                

                 so during sign in we would get the salt from db and add it to password and check if the hash is same


zod is required because we expect a string but the user can send anything like an object empty string etc
so we should do input validation
